                <span>The general sibling CSS combination use 
                the "~" sign to denote relations between the different
                selectors of CSS.
            
                The "~" specifies that the two selectors are in the
                same level with the same parent.

                However, if these two selectors are right next to each
                other, it is recommend to use the adjacent sibling
                sign instead.

                General siblings are like siblings in real life
                only that they are born next to each other.
