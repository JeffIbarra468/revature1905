        <p>For the adjacent sibling CSS combination, we use the "+" sign
            to denote relations between the different selectors of CSS.
            
            What the "+" specifies is that the two selectors are immediately
            next to each other in the same level.

            In the case that two selectors are seperated by another the
            adjacent selector, the "+" sign will not work under this circumstance.
            For that one will have to use the general sibling combination sign.
            <br>
            <br>
            Adjacent siblings are like siblings in real life only that 
            they are born next to each other.
