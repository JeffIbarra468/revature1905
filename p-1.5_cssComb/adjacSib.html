        <span>For the adjacent sibling CSS combination, we use the "+" sign
            to denote relations between the different selectors of CSS.
            
            What the "+" specifies is that the two selectors are immediately
            next to each other in the same level.

            In the case that two selectors are seperated by another the
            adjacent selector, the "+" sign will not work under this circumstance.
            For that one will have to use the general sibling combination sign.

            Adjacent siblings are like siblings in real life only that 
            they are born next to each other.
